# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)

#shoes = Shoe.create([{name: 'Retro 3 UNC'}, {description: 'Fire and the colorway is a classic'}, {image: 'https://houseofheat.co/app/uploads/2020/02/where-to-buy-air-jordan-3-unc-ct8532-104-8-1200x750.jpg'}])
